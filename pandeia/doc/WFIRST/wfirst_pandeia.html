            Introduction to Pandeia for WFIRST
        </h3>

        <p>
        Pandeia is the exposure time calculator (ETC) system that is being developed for the James Webb Space Telescope
        (JWST).  It's based on a Python engine that calculates three-dimensional data cubes, based on user-specified spatial
        and spectral properties of one or more sources. The cubes are projected to a detector plane given an instrument
        configuration and two-dimensional pixel-by-pixel signal and noise properties are extracted.  This allows for appropriate
        handling of realistic point spread
        functions (as calculated by <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/wfirst/software/webbpsf">WebbPSF</a>), MULTIACCUM detector
        readouts, correlated detector readnoise, dithering, and multiple photometric and spectrscopic extraction strategies.
        Pandeia includes support for a wide variety of observing modes and has a highly modular, data-driven design that allows
        for easy extensibility to other instruments and telescopes.
        </p>

        <p>
        This extensibility has been applied to create an implementation of the WFIRST Imager (WFI), as it is currently
        prototyped.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Functionality
        </h3>

        <p>
        Pandeia is designed to perform high-fidelity modeling of a small, representative portion of a detector image and to
        allow for extensive parameter space investigations.
        This typically small "postage-stamp" field of view is referred to as the "scene" and is composed of one or more
        astronomical sources.  The size of the scene
        is dynamic and can in principle be arbitrarily large.  However, because of the detail involved in the calculations
        Pandeia performs, calculations for very large scenes are not currently supported.
        <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/wfirst/software/STIPS">STIPS</a> is the more appropriate tool for simulating full fields
        of view.
        </p>

        <p>
        Pandeia supports both point and extended sources.  Extended sources are modeled by a Sersic surface brightness profile
        with major/minor axis scale lengths, a position angle, and a Sersic index (e.g. n=1 for exponential disk, n=0.5 for
        gaussian, and n=4 for de Vaucoulers).  A wide variety of source spectra are available for use
        including power-law, blackbody, stars (via a grid of
        <a href="http://www.hs.uni-hamburg.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14&Itemid=891&lang=en">Phoenix
        models</a>), and integrated spectra of a range extragalactic objects
        (via <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/212/2/18/meta">Brown et al. (2014)</a>).  It is also
        possible to add emission and absorption lines to a spectrum as well as input custom spectra. Normalization of source flux is
        accomplished by providing a flux density (e.g. mJy or AB mag) at a specific wavelength or a magnitude in a specific
        bandpass (e.g. SDSS <it>z</it>).
        </p>

        <p>
        The output of a Pandeia calculation provides 2D signal-to-noise maps as well as extracted flux and signal-to-noise
        products that are defined by a flux extraction strategy.  For WFIRST imaging, this consists of aperture photometry
        with a circular source aperture and annular background estimation region.  WFIRST IFU will support strategies that use
        dithers to facilitate background subtraction.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Using Pandeia-WFIRST
        </h3>

        <p>
        Pandeia is currently under rapid development in the lead-up to the initial limited release for JWST in 2016.  As such,
        it must be considered <em>a work in progress</em>.  Several planned features are not yet implemented.
        </p>

        <p>
        The code for Pandeia is not yet openly available and the only
        way to access it currently is via a <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebook interface on the WFIRST
        <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub">JupyterHub</a> server at
        <a href="https://wfirst-tools.stsci.edu">https://wfirst-tools.stsci.edu</a>.  Please refer to our
        <a href="file:///wfirst/software/wfirst-tools-server">WFIRST Tools Server</a> page for details on how to request an account
        and how to access/use the system.  Since the software is presently
        in beta release, access is restricted to people connected to the WFIRST Project and Science Teams.
        </p>

        <p>
        Example notebooks are provided on the JupyterHub server that include simple GUIs for configuring calculations and
        displaying basic results. They also contain more detailed examples and documentation on how to customize the
        calculation inputs, analyze the outputs, and set up scripts for doing batch analysis.
        </p>

            An example of a Pandeia-WFIRST calculation that has been modified to add a second source.  This illustrates Pandeia's
            ability to model multiple sources of various sizes, shapes, and positions and thus include the effects of
            contaminating flux in the final signal-to-noise calculations.

        <h3>
            Documentation
        </h3>

        <p>
            Much of the Pandeia documentation has yet to be written. Some basic API documentation will be provided along with the
            notebooks. A paper describing the general approach, features, and design of Pandeia is in preparation.  For now
            users are encouraged to cite the Pandeia paper Pontoppidan et al. (2016, in prep.) which will be presented at the
            SPIE Astronomical Telescopes and Instrumentation conference in 2016.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Assumptions and Caveats
        </h3>

        <p>
            Pandeia functionality in general and its WFIRST functionality in particular is still in continued development.
            The present implementation is made available to the community as a <strong>beta</strong> version.
        </p>
        <p>
            The WFIRST Mission is not yet in development and observatory designs continue to evolve.  Hence, Pandeia simulations
            may not accurately reflect the actual future observatory.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this stage the model for the WFI makes several assumptions and approximations:
            <ul>
                <li> The Pandeia WFIRST WFI model is based on the Cycle 5 WFIRST design revision and it incorporates information
                    from the <a href="http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/Instrument_Reference_Information.html">GSFC Instrument
                        Reference Information</a> files.
                <li> PSFs are obtained using the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/wfirst/software/WebbPSF">WebbPSF</a> software
                    for a notional point within the WFI field-of-view. The field-dependence of the PSF is not currently accounted
                    for within Pandeia.
                <li> The filter transmission for broad-band PSF and Pandeia calculations is assumed to be flat across the filter
                    bandpass.
                <li> The readout pattern and subarray configurations are modeled after those currently planned for JWST's NIRCam
                    imager.
            </ul>
        <p>

        <h3>
            Future Improvements
        </h3>

        <p>
            We are planning on many additions and improvements for future Pandeia versions. These include the following:
            <ul>
                <li> Support for WFI IFU and grism observations (coming soon)
                <li> Support for observations with the WFIRST Coronagraph (planned for later)
                <li> Improvements to the graphical notebook interface to support new observing modes, support adding
                    multiple sources to a calculation, and expanding the ways to define source flux (e.g. SDSS magnitudes).
                <li> Better filter transmission curves, once these have been measured and released by the project.
                <li> Other fixes and features based on community feedback.
            </ul>
        </p>
