Support for dated backgrounds is presently restricted for two reasons:
  - BMG 4.0 supports only 10/1/2018 - 4/30/2029
  - Stray light data has only been computed for a few locations on the
  sky*, not all of which are observable year round

These positions are given in the table below. Data is available at the
given declination in a band roughly +/- 25 degrees in RA about the
target's RA. (Conversion is left as an exercise for the users.)

NEP          18 00 00.00  66 33 38.5  year round
SEP          06 00 00.00 -66 33 38.5  year round
HDF-N        12 36 49.50  62 12 58.0  11/09 to 05/28
HDF-S        22 32 56.00 -60 33 00.0  04/24 to 11/10
HUDF         03 32 39.00 -27 47 29.0  07/27 to 02/06
NCP          00 00 00.00  90 00 00.0  11/09 to 04/01
Lockman Hole 10 45 00.00  58 00 00.0  11/03 to 05/15
Posn(0, 0)   00 00 00.00  00 00 00.0  06/17 to 08/06,  11/07 to 01/02

The user must take both sets of constraints into account.

The second constraint is temporary, and will be removed when the
entire stray light cache has been generated (ETA March 2016). 

The first constraint is sufficiently close to the projected lifetime
of the JWST mission that it is effectively permanent, although the
exact date range may change as updates to the JWST ephemeris are
applied. 


*Note that the stray light data was computed based on an earlier
 delivery of the Background Model Generator (BMG), so it is likely not
 perfectly consistent with the in-field background computed with BMG 4.0.
