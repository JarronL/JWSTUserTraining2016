Mark's work pattern:

Install the system as described in doc/install/install.txt .  This
assumes an empty system, rather than trying to work with your
existing environment.  The advantage of doing this is that you have
a reproducible install that resembles the production install.  (If
you want to construct your own install, you'll have to figure out
how to make it work and how to fix it if it breaks.)

When you take your laptop from place to place, its name changes.
You may find it necessary to re-initialize your database.

To work on a system that contains a server:

create 3 terminal windows.  In each terminal window, type

	 ur_setup - pda

then enter one of these commands in each

	xtname start
	xtname ui_install
	xtname engine_install
		# xtname is included in ureka

In "start",
	cd ...wherever you installed pandeia...

	setenv STARTER 127
		# for a server on 127.0.0.1 - works without network

	./ctrl is
		# does: shut down, purge, initdb, start

	./ctrl start
	./ctrl crash
	...etc...
		# see doc/install/run.txt

in "ui_install",

	cd pandeia/ui

	python setup.py install
	cp -r client/. ...wherever you installed pandeia.../client/.

in "engine_install",

	cd pandeia/engine

	python setup.py install


create additional terminal windows for working / editing.

When you edit the client or server, switch to the "ui_install"
window and repeat the install commands.  When you edit the engine,
switch to the "engine_install" window and repeat the commands.
After that, switch to the "start" window and restart the server.
