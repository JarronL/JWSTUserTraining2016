Debugging calculations that from the client
--

If you know the workbook number and calculation number:

	import pandeia.engine.perform_calculation as p
	import pandeia.server.tools.dpc as dpc
	import pandeia.server.worker.engine_check as e

	# load the engine inputs
	d_in=dpc.from_db(1010,1)

	# run the calculation with an elapsed time report
	d_out = dpc.perform_calculation(d_in)

	# run the engine directly
	d_out = p.perform_calculation( d_in )

	# type check the engine output
	e.engine_check(d_out)


misc tools:

	# show dict using pandokia's pretty print
	dpc.dprint(d_in)
	dpc.dprint(d_out,open("f","w"))

	# print key/type hierarchy
	dpc.keys(d_out)

	# tkdiff dict contents
	dpc.ddiff( d1, d2 )

	# tkdiff dict keys/types
	dpc.tdiff( d1, d2 )


looking at the transaction history of a session:

	In debug mode, wssvc keeps a log of the json messages
	transacted in each session.  See log/trans.wssvc*.*

	The number at the end is a monotonically incrementing session
	counter.  You can usually identify the log file you are
	interested in by "ls -ltr"
