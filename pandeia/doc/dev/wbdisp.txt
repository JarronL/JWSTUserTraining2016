Using wbdisp to monitor behaviour of the ui client
--

 
In a development version of pandeia, the landing page has a link
for "Workbook Display test interface".  It links to /dev/wbdisp.html
This is a simplified interface that is mostly read-only.

1) In Window A, log in to the real user interface - you will see a
list of workbooks

2) in Window B, load wbdisp.html - you will see a list of workbooks

3) select a workbook to use as an example

4) Click "load" next to that workbook on Window B; tables with the
content of that workbook will appear.  The backgrounds will be blue.

5) Click "[Load]" for that workbook in Window A.

6) on Window B, click "Clear Table Colors".  All the tables will
turn white.

7) Perform an action in Window A.  When it saves a change, the
server will respond with a message to both windows.

In Window B, each table cell that is updated by a message from
the server will turn blue.  You can identify which cells/rows
were saved by the UI client by observing which cells change colors.
Click "Clear Table Colors" to reset them all to white.

In the calculation table, the "C" will change colors according to
the status of a calculation in progress.

Click on "D" to display the result information for that row.
